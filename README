Some of the models used where obtained from other places than my own creation

Sofa obtained from:
https://grabcad.com/library/sofa-119
By Romankovskii

I tried adding other objects such as a bed or a toilet, but the models disappeared as soon as I exit the Model Editor

I created a different vacuum_robot outside of gazebo but when I imported it the object only contained one link, so I preferred to make another vacuum robot inside of gazebo but a little bit more simple

I decided to make the apartment that I will be moving in, and make a simplistic copy of one the vacuum robots that are in my house
